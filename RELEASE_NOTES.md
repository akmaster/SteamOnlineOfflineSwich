- The program is completely safe and open source

### How It Works (General Principle)
1. **Detection**: Automatically finds supported game client installations.
2. **Process Control**: Manages client processes safely (closing/restarting as needed).
3. **Firewall Rules**: Creates/removes Windows Firewall rules for selected client executables.
4. **Status Tracking**: Shows real-time connection status for the selected client.

## üîí Security & Privacy (General Principles)

- ‚úÖ Uses only Windows built-in firewall
- ‚úÖ No network connections made by the program itself for its core function
- ‚úÖ No data collection or telemetry
- ‚úÖ Open source code available
- ‚úÖ Does not modify game client files
- ‚úÖ Does not access personal data

## üêõ Known Issues (General)

- Game clients may take a few seconds to fully close/restart.
- Some antivirus software may flag new executables (false positive).
- Requires administrator privileges for firewall operations.

## üìû Support (General)

### Getting Help
- Check the README.md file for detailed instructions.
- Use the test_program.py to diagnose system compatibility.
- Report issues on GitHub with system information and selected client.

### Troubleshooting (General)
- **"Client not found"**: Make sure the selected client is installed in a standard location.
- **"Administrator required"**: Always run as administrator.
- **Connection status wrong**: Use "Refresh Status" button for the selected client.

## üîÑ Upgrade Notes

### From Previous Versions (e.g., v1.1.0 to newer multi-client versions)
- Newer versions support multiple game clients.
- The executable and .bat file names have changed to `GameClientController`.
- All previous firewall rules created by older versions (for Steam) should still be manageable if Steam is selected, but it's recommended to manage rules through the latest version of the application.
- No manual cleanup of old rules is strictly required, but you can remove them if you prefer to only use rules created by the new version.

### Breaking Changes
- None - fully backward compatible
