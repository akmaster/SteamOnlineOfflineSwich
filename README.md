## Technical Details

### How It Works
The program uses Windows Firewall rules to control Steam's internet access:

1. **Steam Detection**: Scans common Steam installation paths
2. **Firewall Rules**: Blocks incoming/outgoing traffic for Steam executable files
3. **Status Tracking**: Checks existing firewall rules to show current status

### Security

- Requires no third-party software
- Does not modify Steam files
- Does not interfere with system files

### "Administrator privileges required" Error
